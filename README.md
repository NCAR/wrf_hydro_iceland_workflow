EcFlow WRF-Hydro workflow definitions for the Iceland project

This repository contains ECF scripts and supporting shell scripts for running
the Forcing Engine and WRF-Hydro model. Paths to domain metadata, configuration files,
etc are defined in build_defs_iceland.py. EcFlow definitions must be regenerated and
re-uploaded to the EcFlow server instance after any configuration changes in this file.
